In this Project : 

1. I selected all the data and filtered if there is any blank cell or not 
2. Checked and removed duplicates
3. Found Independent and dependent variables 
      
	  Independent Variables  = Sex, Smoker	, Day , Time , 	size, total_bill
	  Depended variable = Tips
	  
		
		
4. Used Multiple regression analysis to obtain data model as shown in screenshots and excel files

5. Converted categorical values into numerical using IFS condition

5. Then using predictive analysis multiple regression formula, found the predicitve tips along side actual ones 

6. Then found errors in next column

7. Finally calculated RMSE
